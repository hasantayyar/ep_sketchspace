A vector graphics drawing plugin for Etherpad supporting simple shapes and image/pdf pasting. It does not support editing of an uploaded pdf, but drawing on top of it. However, it can handle arbitrarily large pdfs - it has been successfully tested with A2 size pdfs generated by cad software containing millions of details.
Uses Dojo/Dijit for rendering of the graphics.
